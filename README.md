This is my personal fork of lastfm script for irssi:

https://github.com/argp/lastfm-irssi

Usage

Load the Script on irssi

 > load lastfm.pl

Set your nickname

> /np mynickname

After this you can just bind /np to some button combination, no need to add the nickname unless you want to change user.
